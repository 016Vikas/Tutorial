/*
 So just changing the order of the locks prevent the program in going into a deadlock situation and completes with the following result âˆ’
Output
Thread 1: Holding lock 1...
Thread 1: Waiting for lock 2...
Thread 1: Holding lock 1 & 2...
Thread 2: Holding lock 1...
Thread 2: Waiting for lock 2...
Thread 2: Holding lock 1 & 2...
The above example is to just make the concept clear, however, it is a complex concept and you should deep dive into it before you develop your applications to deal with deadlock situations.
